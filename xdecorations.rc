#Example xdecorations config file should be in ~/.config and named xdecorations.rc
#Lines beginning with '#' are comments and ignored.
#To use the default values either comment out the relevant line or remove it.
#
#All values have a command line equivalent, additionally some switches have the form -no-XXX or -XXX, these are simple on/off switches and take no argument on the commandline, but to use them in the config file you need to supply a 0 or 1,ie to either use double buffering or not you would use:
#xdecorations -usebuffer
#or
#xdecorations -no-usebuffer
#
#Command line options override values in this file.
#
#
##### Application config #####
#Default config file is ~/.config/xdecorations.rc
#An alternate config file can be loaded with the command line switch "-configfile /path/to/config/file", or disable loading of default config file with the command line switch "-noconfig" which must be the fitsr option on the command line.

#Set main delay, this will adjust the overall speed of the program keeping the relative delays of the various animations the same.
#If the delay is to small ( <1000, depending on the system ) you may find the graphics breaking up and the program will hog too much processor time, 8000 to 10000 is a good compromise.

#### EXTRAS #####
#These are not used in the config file but are command line switches ONLY.
#Don't load the default config file ( ~/.config/xdecorations.rc ).
#MUST be the firts option given.
#-noconfig

#Set new config file ( using only one instance of this makes any sense )
#This will overwite any options used or any options set in the default config.
#-configfile "/path/to/config/file"

#Write out a new config file including currently loaded config file,defaults and command line options then exit
#-writeconfig  "/path/to/config/file"

#Watch the last loaded config file ( which may be an empty file ) for changes and apply them in real time.
#this is experimental at the moment and will probably be changed in future releases.
